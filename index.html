<h1 style="color:white;font-size:300%;text-align:center">Animal Rescue Station</h1>
<p  style="color:black;font-size:200%;text-align:left">What is Animal Rescue?</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:140%">Animal Rescue Stations is for saving, taking in those animals, which are lost, deserted, abused, and so on, especially dogs and cats. We will take care of them, including training, playing, dealing with medical problems and resolving behavioural problems, and finally find them a suitable permanent home to live.</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:140%">And also, we’d like to appeal to more and more people to protect and be kind to the animals, not only the house pets, but also the wild animals and stray animals. We will show as many animal rescue stations as we can to people all over the world, who like animals but don't know how and where to give them a place to stay.</p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:200%;text-align:left">What is the difference between an Animal Rescue and an Animal Shelter?</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:140%">The differences between animal shelters and animal rescues can be difficult to nail down. This is because there is a great level of ambiguity and flexibility surrounding the two terms. Some places that interpret the term “animal rescue” broadly might even house animal shelters as a subset of animal rescues. If there were to be a key difference it would be that generally speaking, animal shelters tend to have facilities that house animals whereas animal rescues are typically foster-based organizations. This does not mean, however, that animal shelters do not have fosters, as many do. Many animal rescues also partner with boarding facilities to house their animals adding to the ambiguity between the two. Regardless of what they call themselves, both types of organizations have a common goal: they exist to help animals. </p>
<p  style="color:black;font-size:200%;text-align:left">Why should all of us help Animal Rescue and fight against Animal cruelty?</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:left">1. No Living Being Deserves to Be Treated Poorly</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:130%">As sentient beings, animals deserve to be treated fairly with consideration for both their physical and mental well-being. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always happen, so rescue is necessary to help restore well-being for animals that have been neglected, abused, or ignored by society. </p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:left">2. Animals That Get Away Can Be Dangerous to Society</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:130%">Animals can be extremely dangerous. This is not only due to their ability to cause physical harm through bites, scratches, and physical force but also because they can be disease vectors and transmit parasites, rabies, and other diseases to people and other animals. </p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:left">3. Pet Overpopulation</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:130%">Animal rescue and the emphasis placed on spaying and neutering have contributed to the decrease in pet overpopulation. When animals are well cared for and have their needs met, they are less likely to be breeding unintentionally than if they are allowed to wander on their own. </p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:left">4. Ignoring the Problem Contributes to It</p>
<p  style="color:Cadetblue;font-size:130%">The problems of animal overpopulation, neglect, and abuse simply make it grow larger. In order to overcome these issues, they must be faced head-on in a manner that recognizes the sentience of both the animals and people involved in rescue situations. </p>
<p  style="color:black;font-size:200%;text-align:center">How could we rescue those animals?</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">1. Volunteer at your local Animal Secure Stations or Shelters</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">2. Donate supplies or money to Animal Rescue Organizations </p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">3. Foster animals until they find forever homes</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">4. Report Animal Abuse when you see it</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">5. Keep your animals safe</p>
<p  style="color:orange;font-size:160%;text-align:center">6. Stop consuming Animal Products</p>
